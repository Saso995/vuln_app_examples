# Vuln_app_examples

This repository contains two apps, with some vulnerabilities, developed by me and also for each of them a script to exploit the vulnerabilities and a write-up where I do a vulnerability assessments and I also explain how I wrote the scripts.

<br/>
The first chall is an ELF with a string format vulnerability
<br/>
The second chall is a really simple website (available [here](https://act-chall2.herokuapp.com)) with a race condition and also vulnerable to stored XSS
